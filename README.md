**Hello World**<br />
<br />
This repository is for anyone interested in cybersecurity.<br />
I am a cyber security specialist and I'm passionate about raising cyber security awareness and an advocate for helping others get in the field.
I am also in a journey to becoming more technical in the cyber security field and aspire to start a career as a penetration tester.
I will share my notes and learnings in this repository and hope it can help anyone who's interested.
Feel free to share and learn with me!
